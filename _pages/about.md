## Research Interests

My research spans several interconnected domains:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — especially Information Extraction, Question Answering, Semantic Zoning, Knowledge Acquisition from text, and Named Entity Recognition.  
- **Digital Humanities**, including project leadership in initiatives such as **Oupoco** and **French BookNLP**, and coordination within the PSL Master in Digital Humanities.  
- **Language Diversity & Typology**, with a focus on Finnish, Saami, Komi, and broader Uralic languages—and building multilingual parsing models for low-resource languages.   
- Broader thematic interests: Language Acquisition, Cognitive Science, Epistemology, and the History of Linguistics.

## Media & Recognition

- **Oupoco project video**, awarded “Best entertaining video involving AI” at *IJCAI 2023*.  
- Guest on podcasts, including on **France Culture** (computers & poetry, Oct 2023) and **Radio France** (evolution of machine translation, Sept 2020).  
- Contributor to **TheConversation**, and speaker in *Prairie Tutorial* (Oct 2022): *Artificial Intelligence and Society: What Would a Better AI Mean?*.
