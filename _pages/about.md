## About Me

I am a Research Director at **CNRS**, working at **LATTICE** (Languages, Texts, Computational Processing, and Cognition). I hold a **PRAIRIE_PSAI Fellowship** (Paris Artificial Intelligence Research Institute--Paris School of Artificial Intelligence), focusing on **Natural Language Processing**, **Digital Humanities** and the Impact of AI on Society.

I also serve as an **Affiliated Lecturer** in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the **University of Cambridge** and am a member of **Cambridge Digital Humanities**.

My research spans several interconnected domains:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — especially Information Extraction, Question Answering, Semantic Zoning, Knowledge Acquisition from text, and Named Entity Recognition.  
- **Digital Humanities**, including project leadership in initiatives such as **Oupoco** and **French BookNLP**, and coordination within the PSL Master in Digital Humanities.  
- **Language Diversity & Typology**, with a focus on Finnish, Saami, Komi, and broader Uralic languages—and building multilingual parsing models for low-resource languages.   
- Broader thematic interests: Language Acquisition, Cognitive Science, Epistemology, and the History of Linguistics.
