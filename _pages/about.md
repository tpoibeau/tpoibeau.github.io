## About Me

I am a Research Director at CNRS, working at LATTICE (Languages, Texts, Computational Processing, and Cognition). I hold a PRAIRIE_PSAI Fellowship (Paris Artificial Intelligence Research Institute--Paris School of Artificial Intelligence), focusing on Natural Language Processing**, Digital Humanities and the Impact of AI on Society.

I also serve as an Affiliated Lecturer in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge and am a member of Cambridge Digital Humanities.

My research spans several interconnected domains:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) â€” Information Extraction, Question Answering, Semantic Zoning, Knowledge Acquisition from text, and Named Entity Recognition.  
- Computational Humanities - developing new methods and tools for the analysisannotation and analysis of very large corpora of novels,   
- The Impact of AI on Society - impact of translation technology on the translation industry (impact of AI on work); bias in large language models; etc.
