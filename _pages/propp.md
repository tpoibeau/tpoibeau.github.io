A Research-Driven Python NLP Framework for Narrative Analysis

Propp is a Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework developed for the analysis of narrative texts, with a focus on long-form literary fiction.

Designed for computational literary studies, Propp bridges Natural Language Processing and narrative theory to enable character-centric, ontology-based, and corpus-scale analysis of narratives.

The framework is intended for research on characters, narrative structure, and large-scale literary corpora, while remaining accessible to scholars with limited programming experience.
