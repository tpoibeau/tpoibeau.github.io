I am the author of a [book on machine translation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534215/machine-translation/), originally in English and then translated in several langauges (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, french). the French version was published in 2019 and is available [here](https://www.odilejacob.fr/catalogue/sciences/informatique/babel-20_9782738148490.php). 

In 2025, I will publish a new book with [Ubiquity Press](https://ubiquitypress.com/), *Understanding Conversational AI: The Philosophy, Ethics, and Social Impact of Large Language Models*, which will be available in open access. More details soon.
