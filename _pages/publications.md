I am the author of a [book on machine translation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534215/machine-translation/), originally published in English and then translated in several languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, french). The French edition appeared in 2019 and is available [here](https://www.odilejacob.fr/catalogue/sciences/informatique/babel-20_9782738148490.php). 

I have also written books on [information extraction, automatic summarization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-28569-1), and on the relationship between [cognition and computational models](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/language-cognition-and-computational-models/90CC7DBA6CADB1FE361266D311CB4413). 

In 2025, I will publish a new book with [Ubiquity Press](https://ubiquitypress.com/), *Understanding Conversational AI: The Philosophy, Ethics, and Social Impact of Large Language Models*, which will be available in open access. More details soon.

A complete list of my academic publications (journal and conference papers, etc.) is available [here](https://cv.hal.science/thierry-poibeau).
