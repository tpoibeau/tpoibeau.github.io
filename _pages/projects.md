**Current projects**


**Medialex ANR Project**

**Partners:** SciencesPo, CRESST (Polytechnqiue), INA
**Abstract:** How do transformations of the public and media spheres reshape the dynamics of emergence, imposition, and circulation of themes in public debate? Media transformations, particularly those linked to the rise of social networks, have enabled a wider range of actors to feed topics into public debate. The MEDIALEX project seeks to develop a computational approach to the dynamics of influence between legislative and media agendas.

**European Pathfinder Astound Project**
**Partners:** Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, INDEEP AI, Universitätsklinikum Hamburg
**Abstract:** The ASTOUND project (2022–2025), funded by the European Innovation Council, develops new approaches to conversational AI by integrating attention mechanisms and long-term memory, while placing a strong emphasis on ethical design, trust, and responsible use of socially interactive systems.

**GénéAlgoPsy**
**Partners:** Universté Paris-Cité ([Astrid Chevance](https://www.astrid-chevance.fr/)
**Abstract:** The GénéAlgoPsy project (Cultural Genealogy of Mental Pain) investigates the emergence and evolution of uses and representations of the notion of mental pain, a concept still poorly defined compared to physical pain. Led by psychiatrist and public health researcher Astrid Chevance at CRESS (INSERM/Université de Paris/APHP), it aims to clarify how mental pain is understood and differentiated from both the psychological dimension and psychological causes of physical pain.
