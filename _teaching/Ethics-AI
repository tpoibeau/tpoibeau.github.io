**Intensive PSL Week: Ethics of Artificial intelligence**  

The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence course was offered annually during a dedicated PSL Week in November, 
organized by the Master 2 “Intelligence Artificielle, Systèmes et Données” (IASD) program at Université Paris 
Sciences et Lettres (PSL). Designed to engage primarily a technically-oriented audience—particularly computer 
science students—it aimed to foster awareness of the profound transformations ushered in by the digital 
revolution, the existing legal and regulatory frameworks, and the unfolding ethical questions that demand 
thoughtful reflection. ￼ 

The course featured a rich programme of lectures and group work led by experts such as Aïda Elamrani, 
François Goulette, Olivia Tambou, Serge Abiteboul, and Thierry Poibeau. Topics ranged from the ethical 
challenges of digitalization, legal frameworks (including GDPR), and the philosophy of AI, to industry-relevant 
issues like assisted medicine and AI-generated music rights. The evaluation took the form of case-study-based 
group projects, culminating in oral presentations assessed by a jury. The 2024 edition ran from 25 to 29 
November 2024.
