**Intensive PSL Week: Digital Humanities and Artificial Intelligence**  

Held every year in Paris as part of the “DHAI” group activities, this intensive training week brings together 
Master’s and PhD students from AI, the humanities, and the social sciences. It combines lectures, practical 
computer lab sessions, and group work on interdisciplinary projects. The program introduces participants to 
methods such as network analysis, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and applications to archives, 
cultural heritage, and historical corpora.

In each edition, a team of researchers and instructors guide the students through both the technical and 
conceptual dimensions of DH and AI. I contribute an introduction to NLP and also take part in evaluating 
the final group projects. Recent student work has included projects on astronomical diagrams, music generation, 
and sentiment mapping in travel narratives, presented in a concluding session at the end of the week.

See the website of [the last edition](https://semtemiahn.hypotheses.org/intensive-training-week) that was was part of the 
[AISSAI Trimester on AI and Digital Humanities](https://semtemiahn.hypotheses.org/).
